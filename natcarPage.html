		<h1>Autonomous Line Following Robotic Vehicle</h1>
		<p>
		<b>Project Idea</b></br>
		The goal of this project was to create an autonomous line following car that could complete a track that had twists, turns, and crossings to compete in the natcar competition.
		</br>
		<b>Team Members:</b> Cheryl He, Michael Romain
		</br>
		<b>My Responsibilities</b></br>
		Design of PCB for motor circuit, boost converter, voltage regulator, steering and velocity control software, line sensor software, car assembly and mechanical design of 3D printed parts

		Side view of car with all components. The chassis and wheels were provided, the PCB mounting platforms were laser cut out of acrylic, and the camera mount was 3D printed.

		A view of the electronic components of on the car. The main PCB (far right) contains a boost converter and linear voltage regulator to distribute power, a half bridge motor driver, and shoot through protection logic. On the bottom left is the mbed FDRM-KL25Z microcontroller, and above that is the emergency switch which would immediately shut down power to the motors and servo if things went wrong (which they often did!)
