		<h1>Sensory Tryptich Interactiive Watch</h1>
		<p>
			<b>Project Idea</b></br>
				The idea of this project is to study how children interact with electronics outside of the ever present cell phones and laptops. This facet of the project involves creating a wearable device that users can program locations of interest in, which the device then helps them navigate to.
			</br>
			<b>Team Members:</b> Kevin Tian
			</br>
			<b>My Responsibilities</b></br>
				I was responsible for designing and implementing the electrial and software systems for this project. I also helped choose which components we would use based on specifications, size and price.

		Below is a breadboard mockup of all of the working components.
		<img src = "img/breadboardOffAnnotated.jpg" id = "contentImg">
		The components int the annotated breadboard above are:
		<ul>
			<li> Blue: SC16IS770 I2C/SPI to UART converter and GPIO expander</li>
			<li> Red: RFduino microcontroller</li>
			<li> Green: Sharp Memory LCD Display</li>
			<li> Yellow: BNO055 9-axis absolute orientation sensor </li>
			<li> Purple: DRV2605L Haptic Motor Driver </li>
			<li> Orange: MTK3339 GPS </li>
		</ul>
		</br>
		This was an interesting project because it required integrating many devices in a small package. As such, we chose the RFduino as our microcontroller, which has a relatively powerful Cortex-M0 processor in a convenient small package, as well as the possibility of Bluetooth communication. The issue, however, was the relatively small amount of pins available, so we used a SC16IS750 I2C to UART converter and GPIO port expander, which I wrote a simple <a href = "https://github.com/ericoneill10/SC16IS750">library</a> for. This solved our pin and communication issue (and at the same time made communications to certain devices a little more complicated).
		</br>
		I've created a simple <a href = "https://github.com/ericoneill10/placeSearch">web app</a> to help search for locations of interest to load onto the watch.
		</br>
		I'm currently working on a test PCB for this project. Below is the schematic containing all components.

		The first iteration will be a large test PCB created on the Berkeley Invention Lab's in house LPKF PCB drill. Further iterations will shrink the size of the PCB to make it more suitable for a wearable device.
