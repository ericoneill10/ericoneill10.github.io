			<b>Project Idea</p></br>
				The idea of this project is to study how children interact with electronics outside of the ever present cell phones and laptops. This facet of the project involves creating a wearable device that users can program locations of interest in, which the device then helps them navigate to.

			<b>My Responsibilities</b></br>
				I was responsible for designing and implementing the electrial and software systems for this project. I also helped choose which components we would use based on specifications, size and price.

		Below is a breadbord mockup of all of the working components.

		This was an interesting project because it required integrating many devices in a small package. As such, we chose the RFduino as our microcontroller, which has a relatively powerful Cortex-M0 processor in a convenient small package, as well as the possibility of Bluetooth communication. The issue, however, was the relatively small amount of pins available, so we used a SC16IS750 I2C to UART converter and GPIO port expander, which I wrote a simple <a href = "https://github.com/ericoneill10/SC16IS750">library</a> for. This solved our pin and communication issue (and at the same time made communications to certain devices a little more complicated).
