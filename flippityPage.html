		<h1> Flippity Flappity – Mechatronic Fish </h1>

		<p>
			<b>Project Idea</b></br>
			The goal was to create a fun, interactive fish toy that would respond to stimuli with various “emotions”.
			</br>
			<b>Team Members:</b> Ryan Feng, Kevin Tian
			</br>
			<b>My Responsibilities</b></br>
			Programming a finite state machine on an mbed FDRM-KL25Z microcontroller, sensor and actuator control (servos, LED strips, capacitive touch sensors).

			<b>Project Overview</b>
			</br>
			We created a mechanical spine which could be bent using strings controlled from servos located in a central hub.
			</br>
			The orientation of the fish and behavior of the led strips running along the length of the fish would toggle through states that were meant to convey happiness, sadness, curiosity, and anger. The transitions between these states were determined by a state machine programmed onto a microcontroller located on the hub of the fish.

			<hr>
			Full fish without outside covering. The central hub, where the FDRM-KL25Z microcontroler and power routing PCB were locatd, was 3D printed, and the "spine" pieces were laser cut out of wood.
